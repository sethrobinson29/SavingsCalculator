# Savings Calculator

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
My program calculated yearly and monthly returns on a savings account with monthly investments; allowing the user to select an initial deposit, a monthly deposit, and how long to display results for, as well as the option to display the balance of the savings account monthyly for 12 months, or yearly.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the strength of this project was my organization, as well as my modularity, as most of the methods I made can be used in similar programs, or added to other applications, with very few changes, if any at all. I also think making the vectors for displaying the balance private members of the class Investment made the program easier to read and understand.

# Where could you enhance your code?
Most of the mehtods I created could have been inline and defined in my declarations, this would have made compiling more effecient, as well as cleared up the .cpp file, making it easier to see the methods that actually did the computations. 

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this?
The largest error I had was getting the correct output when I changed the table from years to months with the same Investment object. I simply made two separate objects if the user wished to view the balances in month increments. I also used the documentation given to check my code while I was building it, and afterwards ran test cases. I mostly used my own notes, as well as zyBooks to help me remember how to do anything I was confused on, although I may have asked a question or two in the Slack channel.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I finished this project pretty quickly, as it wasn't terribly complex, and with that free time I had plenty of time to check over my program and enusre it worked. The lesson I learned was definitely to get started as early as possible to ensure I have time to check my work. It also gave me time to do some extra examples from the materials and hone my programming skills. The organization of this program is also something I will strive for, while also striving to omprove upon it in whatever ways I can.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is organized neatly, with comments denoting what each section of code, or method, is doing. The class itself is specific to the program, but the program as a whole can be implemented as a feature in a larger application, which is what it was designed to do. The methods themselves could also be lifted and added to another class with only slight modifications.
